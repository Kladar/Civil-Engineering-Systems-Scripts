# Civil Engineering in EES

I took transportation engineering during my undergraduate civil engineering degree.
Most of the problems were sets of linear equations and most of the homeworks were solving essentially the same problem each time.

I received a B in the course, and I attended I think 2 out of 26 lectures. I spent about an hour a week on the course, quickly
flipping through the slides looking for relevant equations, coding them all up in the simple linear solver that is EES, and hittig solve.
Rinse repeat with the next problem. I actually started to love the subject material because it made sense in my brain, but I 
knew it would all go out the window once we have autonomous vehicles. Not just on a speed sense. Pretty much every parameter our roads
are designed around are human factors. Humans are serial operators, so sign spacing and information density is limited. Humans
can't drive 120 miles per hour reliably, so that not only affects how curves, stopping sight distances, exit and entrance ramps, 
and other geometric features are designed, but it affects the /roads/ and their actual building material.

I also took materials of constructed facilities, which has a long section on asphalt pavement and the SUPERPAVE standard, which is 
the grading standard for road pavements. This is affected by weight capacity, traffic density, and regional temperatures, among
other things, and it was a pain in the ass to get passed in the 90s.

Selfdriving cars change all of this. From the math used to create interchanges miles wide to the surface material microstructure
used to make them. We aren't ready for it. Right now selfdriving cars are a retrofit for our current road system, but there's no
reason this should stay the same. The real advantages to be made in transportation are the changes in almost every facet of our 
society, and the ones we aren't thinking of are probably going to be the most expensive and hardest to accomplish (I've never torn up
thousands of miles of roadway). It will affect the soils we use, where we build, how we build, and why. It's going to be fucking insane.
I'm ready for it. 

Anyway, here are all the little EES files I've made while thinking about this stuff and smart-not-hardworking my engineering homework.
